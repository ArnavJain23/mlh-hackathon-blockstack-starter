# Introduction

This is a hackathon boilerplate for a new Blockstack applications created by [Major League Hacking][mlh-github]. It is for hackers looking to get started quickly on a new hackathon project using the Blockstack environment.

You are going to build a Decentralized Application (DApp) called AnimalKingdom. Animal Kingdom is a DApp for the web. Users log into it and create an animal persona that rules over a specific territory. The combination of persona and territory is a kingdom. Once you create a kingdom, you can add subjects from other kingdoms.
 
The Animal Kingdom interacts with two Blockstack services, the [Blockstack Browser](https://browser.blockstack.org) and the [Gaia data storage hub](https://hub.blockstack.org/). The Blockstack Browser is in itself a DApp. The storage hub is purely a service without user-facing functionality.

Preview the [completed version](http://hackp.ac/animal-kingdom) of this application for yourself by using your Blockstack ID. To learn more about this project feel free to complete Blockstacks [Zero to DApp tutorial](http://hackp.ac/zerotodapp).

## Prerequisites

This project requires the following tools:

- Blockstack ID (Identity) - To test your Animal Kingdom
- NPM - A Node.js package manager used to install dependencies.

To get started, install NPM on your local computer if you don't have them already.

## Getting Started

**Step 1. Create a Blockstack IDr**

Open the [Blockstack web application in your browser](http://hackp.ac/blockstack-create).

Blockstack will will prompt you to create or restore an ID.

**Step 2. Install Node Package Manager (NPM).**

The Animal Kingdom uses React, Babel, and many other components. Youâ€™ll use the `npm` command to install these packaged components.

Check if you have `npm` installed by entering the following commabd in your terminal, and see if you get a response back.

```
npm -v
```
git s
If `npm` is not installed, you can download it [here](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)



Open http://localhost:5000 to view it in your browser.

The default port for our app is `5000`, but you may need to update this if your setup uses a different port or if you're hosting your app somewhere besides your local machine.

The app will automatically reload if you make changes to the code. You will see the build errors and warnings in the console.

**Step 3. Create Blockstack ID**

Head over to [Blockstack](http://hackp.ac/blockstack-create) and create a new Blockstack. Name it what you like but this will be the ID you will need to publish DApps to Blockstack, and access other DApps!
